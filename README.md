# Parameter Space
this is my messy code base for "Parameter Space" - my kinetic sculpture project I built in about a week. I plan to extend this into a nice generater for all sorts of cool artsy geometric projects. But for now: handle with care :)

It is based on Three.js, paper.js and paper-offset.
